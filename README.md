# Brief Description
A little game I'm building to my portifolio. The game is being built using Modular customizable systems. Right now I have:

    - A movement system controlled by an event and use reflection to pass data from the object to the behaviour

    - A procedural gun system also oriented by behaviours. This system allow the user to build several guns based on a scriptableObject. The bullets spawning are controlled by some special functions that are mapped using a enum.
